# Did She Cheat?

**A comprehensive, evidence-based resource countering misinformation about trans athletes in sports.**

## What is this?

**didshecheat.org** is a static informational website that directly addresses the false claim that trans women have competitive advantages in sports. It presents peer-reviewed research showing trans women do not have athletic advantages, and actively debunks the methodology and sourcing of sites like SheWon.org and HeCheated.org.

## The Problem

Since 2021, websites like SheWon.org and HeCheated.org have spread dubiously-sourced claims about trans athletes "displacing" or "stealing" medals from cisgender women. These anonymous sites have:

- Used inflated statistics ("900 displaced medals") that artificially calculate any trans athlete medal as a loss
- Made their way from anonymous internet corners to the United Nations, state legislatures, and the U.S. Supreme Court
- Operated with anonymous operators while being documented to have connections to extremist communities
- Ignored the actual systematic inequities affecting female athletes (pay equity, sponsorships, media coverage, harassment accountability)

## The Solution

This site counters misinformation with peer-reviewed research and transparent sourcing:

- **2024 IOC-Funded Study** (British Journal of Sports Medicine): Transgender women demonstrated *lower* performance than cisgender women in strength, power, and aerobic capacity metrics
- **2024 Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism**: Co-authored by Australian Olympian Kirsti Miller, found no significant performance difference after hormone therapy
- **2021 Systematic Review**: Found "no direct and consistent research" supporting athletic advantage claims
- **Olympic Data**: Only 2 trans women out of 71,000 Olympic athletes since 2003—one finished dead last, one finished 37th out of 42

## Why This Matters

Misinformation spreads fast. When dubiously-sourced claims make it to the UN and state legislatures, accurate information needs to be equally accessible. This site ranks high for people asking "Did she cheat?" and presents them with peer-reviewed evidence instead of anonymous misinformation.

The methodology mirrors **howdovaccinescauseautism.org**, which uses the false claim itself as the domain name, making it highly searchable while redirecting people to credible information.

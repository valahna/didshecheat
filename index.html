                <p>"Since the IOC has created a rule for trans athletes to compete in 2003, over 71,000 people have become Olympians. Out of those 71,000 Olympians a total of 2 have been trans women & one came dead last the other came 37th out of 42."</p>

                <p>"Many politicians & the TERFS circulate myths about trans women that are transphobic, harmful, & violent. For example, that trans women will overwhelm women's sport, when trans women are in fact under-represented in sport and especially elite sport."</p>

            <p>This site exists to counter misinformation spread by <strong>SheWon.org</strong> and <strong>HeCheated.org</strong>, which use dubiously-sourced claims and inflated statistics to suggest trans women have competitive advantages—despite peer-reviewed evidence showing the opposite.</p>
            <p>These sites:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <li>Operate anonymously while being connected to extremist communities</li>
                <li>Use artificial calculation methods that inflate "displaced medals" without scientific basis</li>
                <li>Have spread from anonymous internet corners to the United Nations and state legislatures</li>
                <li>Ignore systemic issues affecting all female athletes (pay equity, sponsorships, media coverage, harassment accountability)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you search for information about trans athletes in sports, you deserve accurate, evidence-based answers grounded in peer-reviewed research—not anonymous misinformation. This site provides them.</p>

            <h2>Debunking SheWon.org & HeCheated.org</h2>

            <div class="debunk-item">
                <h3>The "Displaced Medals" Claim</h3>
                <p>SheWon claims hundreds or thousands of female athletes have been "displaced" or had "medals stolen" by trans women.</p>
                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> This methodology is fundamentally dishonest. A trans woman winning a medal doesn't automatically mean a specific cisgender woman "lost" it. These sites count any medal won by a trans athlete as a "displacement," artificially inflating numbers without scientific or logical basis. Even the Supreme Court noted this "calculation algorithm artificially inflates the number of medals 'lost.'"</p>
            </div>

            <div class="debunk-item">
                <h3>Anonymous Sourcing & Extremist Connections</h3>
                <p>SheWon and HeCheated operate with anonymity while being documented to have connections to extremist communities and organizations designated as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>
                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Credible research is transparent about who operates it and where data comes from. Anonymous operations making inflammatory claims while connected to extremist networks are red flags for misinformation. Compare this to Kirsti Miller's open, identified work as a published researcher and Olympian.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="debunk-item">
                <h3>Ignoring Actual Female Athlete Issues</h3>
                <p>These sites focus narrowly on trans athletes while largely ignoring systemic issues affecting all female athletes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pay equity gaps</strong> — Women athletes earn significantly less than men</li>
                    <li><strong>Media coverage disparities</strong> — Women's sports receive minimal broadcast time</li>
                    <li><strong>Sponsorship and advertising inequity</strong> — Less corporate investment in women's sports</li>
                    <li><strong>Sexual assault and harassment accountability</strong> — Widespread institutional problems ignored</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> If these organizations genuinely cared about female athletes' welfare, they would prioritize systemic issues affecting millions. Their narrow focus suggests a political agenda rather than genuine advocacy.</p>

            <div class="debunk-item">
                <h3>Contradicted by Peer-Reviewed Research</h3>
                <p>The major research findings above directly contradict SheWon's core narrative:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2024 IOC-funded study: Trans women performed <strong>worse</strong> than cisgender women in key metrics</li>
                    <li>2024 Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism: No significant performance difference after hormone therapy</li>
                    <li>2021 Systematic Review: "No direct and consistent research" supports athletic advantage claims</li>
                    <li>Olympic data: Only 2 trans women out of 71,000 Olympic athletes since 2003—one finished dead last</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> When your core argument is contradicted by peer-reviewed, IOC-funded research, your credibility is fundamentally compromised. Yet SheWon continues spreading these claims uncritically.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="debunk-item">
                <h3>Female Athletes Support Trans Inclusion</h3>
                <p>SheWon claims to represent female athletes, but research shows otherwise.</p>
                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Studies confirm that the majority of female athletes have no problem with trans women competing in women's sports. The "protection" narrative manufactured by SheWon doesn't reflect what actual female athletes think or want. This is the same "divide and conquer" tactic used to justify bathroom bans and other discriminatory policies.</p>
